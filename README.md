# Flow-Datagrid-Pack

This component makes it easy for you to display a collection of records in a flow. Once displayed, denote if a single or multi-selection is desired. Whether displayed traditionally on a datatable, geographically on a map, or visually in a tile grid, you can make it simple for a user to select the record(s) desired to be used by later steps in the flow.

This app is part of the Forceâ„¢ Collection.

- Map Grid - Display multi-select markers on a map in a flow when your record data needs to be presented on a map.
